Subject: Questionnaire about your empty property report

Hi <?=$values['name']?>,

Getting empty homes back into use can be difficult, properties can
remain empty for many months if the owner is unwilling or the property
is in very poor repair. If nothing has happened or you are not satisfied
with the progress the council is making, now is the right time to say
so. We think it's a good idea to contact some other people who may be
able to help or put pressure on the council For advice on how to do this
and other useful information please go to http://www.emptyhomes.com

Over six months ago, you reported an empty home on ReportEmptyHomes.com
with the details provided at the end of this email. To keep our site up
to date and relevant, I'd be grateful if you could fill in this short
questionnaire to tell us what has happened:
