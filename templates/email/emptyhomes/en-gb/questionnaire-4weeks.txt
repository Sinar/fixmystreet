Subject: Questionnaire about your empty property report

Hi <?=$values['name']?>,

Getting empty homes back into use can be difficult.
If you are not satisfied with progress or information from the council,
now is the right time to say. You may also want to try contacting some
other people who may be able to help. For advice on how to do this and
other useful information please go to
http://www.emptyhomes.com

Over four weeks ago, you reported an empty home on ReportEmptyHomes.com
with the details provided at the end of this email. To keep our site up
to date and relevant, I'd be grateful if you could fill in this short
questionnaire to tell us what has happened:
