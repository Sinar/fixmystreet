<h1><a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>What is AduanKu</dt>
        <dd>AduanKu is a site to facilitate the Rakyat to report simply by locating the issue on a map.
<br/>
<br/>
AduanKu is on a trial run to bring this service to residents initially for Subang Jaya. There are plans to expand this to the rest of the Klang Valley, and eventually the rest of Malaysia.
<br/>
<br/>
The overall aim is to empower the Rakyat to monitor their local authority’s performance and response in attending to their complaints.</dd>
        <dt>How do I get in touch with AduanKu?</dt>
	<dd>You can contact us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:ti-malaysia@transparency.org">ti-malaysia@transparency.org</a></dd>
        <dt>What sort of problems should I report with AduanKu?</dt>
        <dd>AduanKu is primarily for reporting things which are
<strong>broken or dirty or damaged or dumped, and need fixing, cleaning
or clearing</strong>, such as:

    <ul>
      <li>Abandoned vehicles</li>
      <li>Animal faeces</li>
      <li>Graffiti</li>
      <li>Uncollected garbage</li>
      <li>Litter or illegal dumping</li>
      <li>Street cleaning, such as broken glass</li>
      <li>Unlit/faulty lamp posts</li>
      <li>Potholes</li>
    </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>What isn&rsquo;t AduanKu for?</dt>
    <dd>
      AduanKu is not a way of getting in touch with your council for all issues – please use AduanKu only for problems such as the above. Do note however, that some of the problems reported may need to be routed to other departments such as Jabatan Kerja Raya (JKR), Tenaga Nasional (TNB), Telekom Malaysia (TM), Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia (LLM) etc. As such, there may be delays in your report getting to the relevant department and getting resolved.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>You will need to contact you council directly for problems such as</strong>:

    <ul><li>Anti-social behaviour
    <li>Any urgent or emergency problems
    <li>Noise pollution or barking dogs
    <li>Fires and smoke/smell pollution
    <li>Missing wheelie bins or recycling boxes or missed rubbish collections
    <li>Proposals for speed bumps/ CCTV/ pedestrian crossings/ new road layouts/ etc.
    <li>Complaints regarding your neighbours
    <li>Complaints about the council
    <li>Joy riding, drug taking, animal cruelty, or other criminal activity
    </ul>
    <p>Councils often have direct hotlines for these sorts of issues.</p>
    </dd>

        <dt>How do I use the site?</dt>
        <dd>After entering a postcode or location, you are presented
with a map of that area. You can view problems already reported in that area,
or report ones of your own simply by clicking on the map at the location of
the problem.</dd>
        <dt>How are the problems solved?</dt>
        <dd>They are reported to the relevant council by email. The council can then resolve the problem the way they normally would. Alternatively, you can file the problem yourself, using the local councils official channels or discuss the problem on the website with others, and then together lobby the council to fix it, or fix it directly yourselves.
	</dd>
        <dt>Is it free?</dt>
	<dd>
The site is free to use. AduanKu Malaysia is a community based project run by Transparency International Malaysia (<a href="http://www.transparency.org.my">www.transparency.org.my</a>) and Sinar Project (<a href="http://sinarproject.org/">http://sinarproject.org/</a>).

	</dd>
    <dt>Can I use AduanKu on my mobile?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
The AduanKu website should work on your mobile phone, adapting to
    the size of your screen automatically. We plan to release updated native
    apps in the near future.

    <h2><a name="practical"></a>Practical Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>I&rsquo;m from a council, where do you send the reports?</dt>
        <dd>You can either leave a test report or <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
to find out where reports go at the moment. Also <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
to update the address or addresses we use.</dd>
        <dt>Do you remove silly or illegal content?</dt>
        <dd>AduanKu is not responsible for the content and accuracy
of material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to edit or remove any
problems or updates which we consider to be inappropriate upon being informed
by a user of the site.</dd>
    <dt>Why can&rsquo;t I zoom out more on the reporting map?</dt>
    <dd>We want to keep AduanKu locally focused, so restrict the ability to
    move radically between areas. The map on Your Reports will let you see all
    the reports you&rsquo;ve made, wherever they are. If you&rsquo;re from the
    council then the emailed version of the problem report also contains the
    closest road and postcode to the pin on the map.</dd>

    <dt>This site is great – why aren&rsquo;t you better publicised?</dt>
    <dd>As a tiny charity we simply don&rsquo;t have a publicity budget, and we
    rely on word of mouth to advertise the site. We have a whole <a
    href="posters/">array of posters, flyers and badges</a> if you&rsquo;d like
    to publicise us on the web or in your local area, and why not write to your
    local paper to let them know about us?</dd> </dl>
